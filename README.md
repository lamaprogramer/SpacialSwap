# Spacial Swap

### This mod adds an easy way to swap a placed block with a block in your main hand.

Just hold down the spacial swap keybind **(Default is "R")**, and then break a block with the block you want to swap it with in your main hand.

Your main hand will assume the mining speed and power of the strongest tool in your inventory for that block. This means you don't need to constantly swap tools, just choose the block you want to swap with.
